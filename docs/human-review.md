# Human Review Process

This document describes the human review process for LLM evaluation test cases.

## Overview

The human review process allows subject matter experts to:

1. Review and modify test case expected outputs
2. Approve or reject AI-generated responses
3. Provide additional context or nuance to evaluation criteria
4. Track changes to test cases over time

## Review Workflow

### CLI-Based Review

For quick reviews, use the CLI tool:

```bash
python -m src.cli.review --config config/default.yaml --suite customer_service_eval
```

This opens each test case in your text editor for review and modification.

### Web UI (Planned)

For a more user-friendly experience, we plan to implement a web-based review interface:

The web UI will provide:

1. Test case browsing and filtering
2. Side-by-side comparison of expected vs. actual outputs
3. Inline editing of expected outputs
4. Approval/rejection workflow
5. Comment threads for discussion
6. Version history tracking

## Getting Started with Human Review

### 1. Set Up Reviewers

Define reviewers in your configuration file:

```yaml
test_suites:
  - name: "customer_service_eval"
    # ... other config ...
    human_review_required: true
    review_assignment: "customer_service_team@example.com"
```

### 2. Generate Initial Test Cases

Generate initial test cases with either:

- Manual creation
- AI-assisted generation from documentation
- Conversion of existing support interactions

### 3. Review Process

The review process follows these steps:

1. Reviewer receives notification of pending reviews
2. Reviewer examines each test case
3. Reviewer modifies expected outputs as needed
4. Reviewer approves or requests changes
5. Changes are committed to version control
6. Approved test cases are used in evaluations

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule regular reviews of test cases to ensure they remain current
2. **Domain Experts**: Assign reviews to subject matter experts in each domain
3. **Feedback Loop**: Use evaluation results to identify which test cases need improvement
4. **Version Control**: Track changes to test cases to understand how expectations evolve
5. **Calibration**: Periodically calibrate reviewers to ensure consistent standards

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Stage Review**: Implement multi-stage review workflows for critical domains
2. **AI-Assisted Review**: Use AI to suggest improvements to test cases
3. **Automatic Notification**: Send notifications when test cases need review
4. **Review Analytics**: Track review metrics to identify bottlenecks
5. **Integration with Other Systems**: Connect with knowledge bases and support systems
